# codeclan-project01-shelter
A database-managing website made using Sinatra.

The aim was to create a database on the local machine, write some Ruby and postgreSQL code to manage it, and views in ERB managed with Sinatra.

The website is for a fictional animal shelter. There are two separate tables in the database for Animals and Owners, and one to show who owns what.

There are also dynamically-populated 'profile' pages for each animal.
