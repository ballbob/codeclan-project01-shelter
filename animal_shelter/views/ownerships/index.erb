<h2>Adoptions</h2>

<p>We regularly check up on the health progress of each animal we adopt out, because of the particular needs that rescue animals have.</p>

<p>To register a new adoption, click <a href="/ownerships/new">here</a>.</p>

<p>To return the animal to our care, click <a href="/ownerships/delete">here</a>.</p>

<p>To update an ownership, click on the owner name.</p>
